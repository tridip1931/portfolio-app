# The Evolution of Design Tools

*A growing note about how design tools shape our workflows*

I've been reflecting on how dramatically design tools have evolved over the past decade, and how they've shaped not just what we create, but how we think about design problems.

## From Static to Systems

**Early 2010s**: Photoshop and Sketch dominated. Design was largely about creating static compositions.

**Mid 2010s**: Sketch + InVision/Marvel for prototyping. We started thinking in flows and interactions.

**Late 2010s**: Figma emerges. Real-time collaboration changes everything.

**2020s**: Component-based design becomes the norm. We're designing systems, not just screens.

## The Figma Effect

Figma didn't just replace Sketch—it fundamentally changed how design teams work:

- **Real-time collaboration**: Design became less solitary
- **Version control**: No more "final_final_v2.sketch" files  
- **Components & variants**: Systems thinking baked into the tool
- **Dev handoff**: Automated specs and asset generation

## Current Trends

Tools I'm exploring:

- **Framer**: No-code prototyping with real data
- **Linear**: Issue tracking that doesn't make designers cry
- **Notion**: Documentation that actually gets used
- **Arc**: Browser that makes research feel delightful

## Looking Ahead

What's next? Some predictions:

1. **AI integration**: Tools that generate design variations and copy
2. **Real-time user testing**: Prototypes that can A/B test themselves
3. **Cross-platform design**: Single source of truth for web, mobile, and beyond
4. **Automated accessibility**: Tools that catch issues before humans do
