# MDX Integration Test

Welcome to our MDX test page! This page demonstrates that MDX is working correctly with Next.js App Router.

## Features Working

✅ **File-based routing**: This page is accessible at `/test-mdx`  
✅ **Frontmatter**: Metadata is properly parsed  
✅ **Custom components**: See the examples below  
✅ **Markdown syntax**: Headers, lists, links, and more  

## Custom Components Demo

<CaseStudyHeader 
  title="Sample Case Study" 
  client="Demo Client" 
  year="2024" 
  role="Product Designer" 
/>

<ProcessSection title="Process Demo">

This is a custom ProcessSection component that helps organize content in case studies. It provides:

- Consistent styling across case studies
- Clear content hierarchy  
- Semantic HTML structure
- Responsive design

</ProcessSection>

## Typography Examples

Here's how different text elements look:

### This is a heading level 3

Regular paragraph text with **bold text** and *italic text*. You can also include `inline code` and [links to other pages](/).

> This is a blockquote that demonstrates our custom styling. It's perfect for highlighting important quotes from users or stakeholders.

#### Code Blocks

```jsx
// Code blocks have syntax highlighting
const ExampleComponent = ({ title }) => {
  return (
    <div className="example">
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <p>This is a React component example</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### Lists

Unordered list:
- First item
- Second item  
- Third item with more details

Ordered list:
1. Research phase
2. Design exploration
3. Prototyping and testing
4. Final implementation
